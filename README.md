# JavaScript Mind Reader
  Hello &amp; welcome to "JavaScript Mind Reader Game". It's a simple game made with JavaScript which can read your mind. :) All you need to do here is to select one item in your mind from 2 rows and click one button depending current position of your selected item. Means, if your item is in first row then click "First Row" button and if in second row then click "Second Row" and continue this process till final step.  By this way, after 3 steps of filtering It'll show your selected item. Try it! :)
